# Simple Serverless app for image upload and Content Moderator

App created for serverless presentation demo.

## Azure resources used

To build this app I used:

- Azure Functions
- Azure Storage (Blob)
- Logic App
- Service Bus
- Content Moderator (Cognitive Services)

## Azure Resource Manager Template

For simpler re-use of this app I created ARM template and PowerShell script to deploy this solution onto Azure. You can foind it in [ARM folder](https://github.com/michalchecinski/Serverless-Image/tree/master/ARM).
