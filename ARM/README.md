# Azure Resource Manager Template

For simpler re-use of this app I created ARM template and PowerShell script to deploy this solution onto Azure. I highly recommend to firstly read what ARM template is, how to use it, and what is doing this particular template. Also I suggest to rename resources to your own preferences. It is done by copy file parameters.default.json to parameters.json and editing it.

To deploy just run deploy.ps1 script.
